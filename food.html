                <p>Origin: Fresh Flower Cake is a crispy pastry made with Yunnan's unique edible rose petals, representing a classic Yunnan specialty dessert.</p>
                <p>Taste: It has a refreshing floral aroma, sweet but not cloying. When you take a bite, you can see whole flower petals inside, and there's no overwhelming sweetness in the filling. It's like biting into a fresh flower.</p>
                <p>Ingredients: Authentic Fresh Flower Cakes are made with edible double-petal roses grown in Anning, Yunnan, and preserved with honey. The pastry is made by repeatedly rolling out dough with butter. Handmade and freshly baked Fresh Flower Cakes have a sweeter and more fragrant texture.</p>

                <p>Fragrant Bamboo Rice is known for its rich Dai ethnic flavor. Inside the bamboo tube, there is a fragrant membrane that emits a delightful aroma, hence the name "Fragrant Bamboo." It is prepared by placing it in hot ashes and roasting it over charcoal. After around 10 minutes when steam begins to escape from the bamboo tube's opening, it is taken out. To eat it, a wooden mallet is used to gently tap the rice, making it soft and aromatic. When eaten, it has a fragrant and tender texture, creating a unique and delightful flavor.</p>

                <h2 class="paragraphTitle">Crossing Bridge Noodle</h2>
                <p>Legend has it that a long time ago, there was a scholar studying in a pavilion at the center of Nanhu Lake in Yunnan. Every day, his wife would cross a bridge to bring him food. One day, the wife, seeing how hard her husband worked, decided to stew a chicken and put it in a clay pot to send to him. However, she got delayed on the way, and when she returned, she found that the chicken in the clay pot was still hot. Upon opening the pot, she discovered a thick layer of chicken fat on top. She then used the chicken fat to cook rice noodles for her husband. The scholar was so impressed with the taste that he couldn't stop praising it. Since the wife had to cross a bridge at Nanhu Lake every day to deliver food, the scholar named the dish "Crossing Bridge Noodle". </p>

                <h2 class="paragraphTitle">Rushan Cheese</h2>
                <p>Origin: "Yunnan's Eighteen Oddities, milk turned into fans for sale" refers to a unique dairy product primarily produced in Eryuan County, Dali Prefecture, Yunnan. It involves adding acidulated water to milk, repeatedly stirring it to solidify, and then crafting it into extremely thin sheets resembling parchment. It is a low-moisture form of cheese.</p>
                <p>Taste: When deep-fried, it turns into a golden-brown delicacy covered in bubbles, reminiscent of the taste of baked cheese. Locals also enjoy it by coating it with sugar or honey, resulting in a rich, chewy texture and a mouthful of milky goodness.</p>
                <p>Ingredients: Fresh cow's milk or goat's milk.</p>

                <h2 class="paragraphTitle">Wild Mushroom Hot Pot</h2>
                <p>A wild mushroom hot pot involves cooking nearly 30 varieties of wild mushrooms in a hot pot. The base for this hot pot is made using old mushroom broth, which combines over seven types of wild mushrooms and high-calcium ingredients, simmered for seven hours. It also includes a specially developed mushroom dish (where the mushrooms are blanched, roasted, and stir-fried with millet chili), served alongside the wild mushroom hot pot. This not only retains the fragrance of the wild mushrooms but also caters to the dining preferences of Kunming residents, who enjoy the combination of a fragrant and spicy meal.</p>
