                <p>The Bai ethnic group, residing in China's Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, celebrates a rich culture centered around the color white, symbolizing nobility and purity. Their clothing features predominantly white with blue, red, and black accents. Men wear white or blue headwraps, shirts with black-collar jackets, pants with blue trim, and handmade cloth shoes, often adding intricately embroidered bags. Bai women's clothing is diverse and detailed, with exquisite floral and animal embroidery, each motif carrying cultural significance. For example, butterflies symbolize a happy family, and mandarin ducks represent marital harmony in their embroidered pillows during weddings.</p>

                <p>Bai ethnic embroidery is a handicraft of Bai women. It is popular in the various towns and villages of the Dali Bai ethnic area. It is widely used in everyday items such as clothing, headwear, shoes, bags, needlework bags, pillowcases, curtains, and more. Common patterns include peonies, Buddha's hands, pomegranates, chrysanthemums, peaches, plums, bamboo, various flowers and fruits, as well as animals like lions, tigers, dragons, phoenixes, goldfish, roosters, squirrels, butterflies, and geometric shapes.</p>
                <p>In Dali, the Bai people, nestled in the mountains and by the waters, have their own unique cultural aesthetics. Building on the foundation of embroidery craftsmanship passed down through the generations, they express their emotions through their work, weaving intricacy and delicacy into their embroidered pieces. Along the paths of the stitching, where the pattern colors shift continuously, it represents not only the Bai people's control over their embroidery but also an artistic response to their everyday lives.</p>

                <h2 class="paragraphTitle">Bai Ethnic Tie-dye</h2>
                <p>Tie-dyeing is typically done using raw materials like white cotton fabric or cotton-linen blend fabric. The primary dye used is natural indigo, often referred to as "板蓝根" in Chinese, and the dyeing process involves repeated cold processing by hand. This results in a natural and long-lasting color. Bai ethnic tie-dyeing has a unique production process, with a particular emphasis on two key steps: "扎花" (Tying Patterns) and "浸染" (dyeing).</p>
                <p>"Tying Patterns" mainly involves stitching and tying, using various methods like single-needle tying, multi-needle tying, wrapping, bundling, coiling, and more. There are over 30 different stitching techniques, including tying, pinching, wrinkling, folding, and picking, and the choice of technique depends on the complexity of the pattern and the desired artistic effect. After selecting the fabric and determining the preferred pattern, the fabric is crumpled, folded, rolled, or squeezed in various ways. It is then stitched or tied with a needle and thread to create tight, intricate knots, forming clusters of "bumps" on the fabric.</p>
                <p>Once the fabric with these "bumps" is prepared, it is soaked in clear water, placed in a dye vat, and subjected to cold dyeing or heated dyeing methods. After a certain period, it is removed, allowed to dry, and then returned to the dye vat for further dyeing. This process is repeated several times, with each dyeing cycle intensifying the color, gradually achieving the desired depth of color, often described as "青出于蓝" (meaning that blue comes from indigo, indicating a deeper shade with each dyeing cycle).</p>
