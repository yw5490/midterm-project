                <p>The Erhai Lake Ecological Corridor is a boundary between people and the lake, allowing Erhai Lake to "breathe" despite the physical separation. It connects various villages along the lake's shoreline, turning the distinct Bai ethnic traditional villages into a "string of pearls around Erhai Lake." As you walk along the ecological corridor, a nostalgic picture unfolds slowly before your eyes.</p>

                <p>There is a beautiful legend passed down among the people of Dali as to why the snow on Cang Mountain never melts for thousands of years. According to the legend, in ancient times, a group of plague demons wreaked havoc in the Dali region, causing "ten people to fall ill, nine of them to die." In order to save the suffering Bai people, a brother and sister of the Bai ethnic group sought the help of Guanyin Bodhisattva. Guided by Guanyin Bodhisattva, they learned the necessary methods and returned to drive all the plague demons to the top of Cang Mountain, freezing them to death with heavy snow. To ensure that the plague demons would never return, the siblings transformed into the Snow Gods of Cang Mountain, forever guarding against the resurrection of the plague demons. As a result, Cang Mountain's Snowman Peak has retained its white snow for thousands of years.</p>

                <p>Dali Ancient Town, originally built during the Tang Dynasty, served as the capital of the Nanzhao Kingdom and was an important node on the ancient Silk Road. Located on the former site of the ancient Nanzhao Kingdom, it has been remarkably preserved and retains numerous Ming and Qing Dynasty architectural structures, exhibiting a unique architectural style that combines the characteristics of the Bai ethnic group and the Han Chinese. The ancient town, virtually synonymous with the city of Dali, is laid out in a well-planned square shape with four well-preserved city walls and four city gates - the North Gate, South Gate, East Gate, and West Gate. Situated on the eastern bank of Erhai Lake with the Cang Mountains to the west, Dali Ancient Town exudes an old-world charm while also reflecting a touch of Western culture. Visiting Dali is like engaging in a conversation with history, soaking in the picturesque landscapes of Cang Mountain and Erhai Lake, immersing yourself in the charms of the ancient town, and savoring the vibrant local traditions and the diverse array of delicious cuisine.</p>
